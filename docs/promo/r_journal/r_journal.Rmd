abstract: >
  Indicator variables are easy to create, store, and interpret [@10.1177/1536867X19830921].  They concisely encode information about the presence or not of a condition for observational units.  The variable name encapsulates the information about the condition of interest, and the variable's values (TRUE and FALSE, 1 or 0, "Yes" or "No") indicate if the condition is met for the observational unit.  When using indicator variables to use in summary products, analysts often make a choice between using an indicator variable as-is or crafting categorical variables where values can be directly interpreted.  Using the indicator variable as-is may be motivated by time savings, but yields poor results in summary products.  {{ind2cat}} can help analysts concisely translate indicator variables to categorical variables for reporting products, yielding more polished outputs.  By default, ind2cat creates the categorical variable from the indicator variable name, resulting in a light weight syntax.

```{r, include=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = F, 
                      warning = F, 
                      comment = "    ", 
                      out.width = "69%")

<!-- ## Introduction -->

<!-- Introductory section which may include references in parentheses -->
<!-- [@R], or cite a reference such as @R in the text. -->

<!-- ## Section title in sentence case -->

<!-- This section may contain a figure such as Figure \ref{fig:Rlogo}. -->

<!-- ```{r, Rlogo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The logo of R.', out.width='2in', fig.align='center', fig.pos='htbp'} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics('Rlogo-5.png') -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Another section -->

<!-- There will likely be several sections, perhaps including code snippets, such as: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- x <- 1:10 -->
<!-- plot(x) -->
<!-- library(tidyverse) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Summary -->

<!-- This file is only a basic article template. For full details of _The R Journal_ style and information on how to prepare your article for submission, see the [Instructions for Authors](https://journal.r-project.org/share/author-guide.pdf). -->

<!-- ### About this format and the R Journal requirements -->

<!-- `rticles::rjournal_article` will help you build the correct files requirements:  -->

<!-- * A R file will be generated automatically using `knitr::purl` - see -->
<!-- https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/purl.html for more information. -->
<!-- * A tex file will be generated from this Rmd file and correctly included in -->
<!-- `RJwapper.tex` as expected to build `RJwrapper.pdf`. -->
<!-- * All figure files will be kept in the default rmarkdown `*_files` folder. This -->
<!-- happens because `keep_tex = TRUE` by default in `rticles::rjournal_article` -->
<!-- * Only the bib filename is to modifed. An example bib file is included in the -->
<!-- template (`RJreferences.bib`) and you will have to name your bib file as the -->
<!-- tex, R, and pdf files. -->
